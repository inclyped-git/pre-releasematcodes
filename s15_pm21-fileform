#A data logger records the temperature on the roof of a school twice a day, at midday and midnight. Input and store the temperatures recorded for a month. You must store the temperatures in two one dimensional arrays, one for the midday temperatures and one for the midnight temperatures. All the temperatures must be validated on entry and any invalid temperatures rejected. You must decide your own validation rules. You may assume that there are 30 days in a month.
