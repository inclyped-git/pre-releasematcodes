# pre-releasematcodes
Description:
This branch provides all neccessary information to know about this repository and additional information about the overall creation of the repository.
Please make sure to check out "ExamInfo-RevCitation" for further inquiries about the exams and software I used to code on.

Information:
This repository provides modal answers to the questions asked in the pre-release materials from 2015 in the Cambridge Computer Science (0478) course. These codes are not charged with money or with any license; you can completely use it for your own purpose and edit to make potential changes to the code or use it to aid your revision for the PAPER-2 of the 0478 course.

Notice:
Don't use these codes with intention of maliciously harming other users. Keeping users secured is the top priority and such actions lead to severe consequences and such on.

Further notice:
These answers are MODAL and they don't relate to the mark schemes shown in the papers. These are all implemented in python IDEs and not in pseudocode form. You can convert the codes into pseudocode as you go through the end of the course. Leave any feedback in case of any improvements or errors need to be fixed. Thanks for your support.
