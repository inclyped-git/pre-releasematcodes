eights of each pupil. The weight, in kilograms, of each pupil is recorded on the first day of term. Input and store the weights and names recorded for a class of 30 pupils. You must store the weights in a one-dimensional array and the names in another one-dimensional array. All the weights must be validated on entry and any invalid weights rejected. You must decide your own validation rules. You may assume that the pupils’ names are unique. Output the names and weights of the pupils in the class.
